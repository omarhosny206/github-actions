# GitHub Actions ü™ê

## Description ‚úç
### This is a Spring Boot Rest API. I'm trying here to run a _CI/CD_ pipeline starting from building the docker image till deploying the container to _AWS EC2 Ubuntu_ instance every time I push updates to the master branch. Here are the steps:

## _Continuous Integration (CI)_ ‚úÖ
- Checkout code.
- Login to dockerhub.
- Build docker image that contains the Spring Boot Rest API and tag it with the commit sha.
- Push the docker image to dockerhub.

## _Continuous Deployment (CD)_ üöÄ
- Stop running docker containers.
- Delete existing docker images.
- Pull docker image that contains the Spring Boot Rest API.
- Run docker container and expose port _8080_.

## Getting Started ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
***NOTE***: you can either setup it manually or simply run [```install-runner.sh```](./install-runner.sh) file to create a docker container that acts as a runner.


### Manually Setup AWS EC2 Ubuntu Runner ‚öôÔ∏è
```text
visit https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>/settings/actions/runners
click "New self-hosted runner"
choose runner image & architecture from the options macOS, Linux and Windows.
follow the commands (with the normal user **"ubuntu"** and not the root user)
```

### Manually Setup AWS EC2 Ubuntu Runner Service ‚öôÔ∏è
```shell
# do the following (with the normal user **"ubuntu"** and not the root user) to enable the ec2 instance to listen to the jobs triggered by the workflow.
# micro is a terminal-text-editor, to install it, run this command "sudo apt install micro"
sudo micro /etc/systemd/system/github-runner.service
