# GitHub Actions 🪐

## Description ✍
### This is a Spring Boot Rest API. I'm trying here to run a _CI/CD_ pipeline starting from building the docker image till deploying the container to _AWS EC2_ instance every time I push updates to the master branch. Here are the steps:

## _Continuous Integration (CI)_ ✅
- Checkout code.
- Login to dockerhub.
- Build docker image that contains the Spring Boot Rest API and tag it with the commit sha.
- Push the docker image to dockerhub.

## _Continuous Deployment (CD)_ 🚀
- Stop running docker containers.
- Delete existing docker images.
- Pull docker image that contains the Spring Boot Rest API.
- Run docker container and expose port _8080_.
